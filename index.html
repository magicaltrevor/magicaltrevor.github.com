          <h3>Welcome to my home on Github!</h3>

<p>I <em>LOVE</em> data! I love all aspects of it. Storing it, sorting it, collecting it, moving it around, and searching it. Lately my projects have been revolving around getting incompatible data sources to talk to each other!</p>

<p>My ultimate goal is to figure out a way to tap into data in the real world creating a seamless data driven fusion between the real world and the digital one is my ultimate dream. I want to be able to record my thoughts to the cloud and to be able to tap into google with my mind. </p>

<p>This is all off in the distant future so in the meantime I hone my skills in software translation and hardware hacking.</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Currently I'm the Director of Software Development for Digital Architecture. We create a course catalog management product for higher education. This presents all kinds of cool ways to get systems to talk to each other and spin data in a meaningful way! I have a GREAT team of developers and an AMAZING systems team who help make all of this stuff happen. I'm lucky to get to be the guy to help coordinate it all.</p>

<p>My expertise lies in MySQL DBA, System Administration (Linux), Python development (primarily but can work in PHP, Ruby(if I have to), Perl, C, C++, Bash(yes, it's a language.), and others that I'm too rusty at to mention here.</p>

<p>I have a lot of experience in IT management and leading development teams. It's not my favorite thing to do but if I've got a good team behind me I don't mind it. I really prefer rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty and leaving the administrivia for those who are better suited to handle it.(See what I did there with the Suit thing...I made a corporate joke.)</p>

<p>I would call myself a backend developer basically due to my fear of Javascript, CSS, the DOM, and anything having to do with design. I'm just not good at it don't even ask. I am really good at supporting those guys and can whip together a web service that grabs presents the data in an easily consumable format in a flash!</p>

<h3>Why this page?</h3>

<p>Because I want to be more social dammit! I've gone through webpages in the past that don't stick around and don't get updated, but I'm in my git repo all the time. Hopefully I can stay on top of this one. I hope to make more of my work available open source (I'm shy.). And hope to get involved in more projects. IF you need a hand with MySQL type stuff or Python things, let me know! </p>
